# LEAF Baselines

This folder contains scripts to help run experiments using the [LEAF set of datasets](https://github.com/TalwalkarLab/leaf).

Throughout these scripts the following is assumed:
    - You have downloaded the LEAF git repository into `${LEAF_ROOT}`.
    - You have downloaded the Flower git repository into `${FLOWER_ROOT}`.
    - You want to save files inside `${SAVE_ROOT}`
  
Remember to `export` these variables before running any `create_dataset*` script.


Finally, please remember to also cite the original ["LEAF: A Benchmark for Federated Settings"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01097) paper if you use it in your work.
