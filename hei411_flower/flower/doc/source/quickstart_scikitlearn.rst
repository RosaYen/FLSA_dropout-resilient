Quickstart (scikit-learn [code example])
========================================

Let's build a federated learning system using scikit-learn and Flower!

Before scikti-learn and Flower can be imported we have to install both:

.. code-block:: shell

  $ pip install -U scikit-learn flwr

For the next steps, please refer to the `full code example <https://github.com/adap/flower/tree/main/examples/sklearn-logreg-mnist>`_.
