Evaluation
==========

There are two main approaches to evaluate models in federated learning systems: centralized (or server-side) evaluation and federated (or client-side) evaluation.

Centralized Evaluation
----------------------

Built-In Strategies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All built-in strategies support centalized evaluation by providing an evaluation function during initialization.
An evaluation function is any function that can take the current global model parameters as input and return evaluation results:

.. code-block:: python

    def get_eval_fn(model):
        """Return an evaluation function for server-side evaluation."""

        # Load data and model here to avoid the overhead of doing it in `evaluate` itself
        (x_train, y_train), _ = tf.keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()

        # Use the last 5k training examples as a validation set
        x_val, y_val = x_train[45000:50000], y_train[45000:50000]

        # The `evaluate` function will be called after every round
        def evaluate(weights: fl.common.Weights) -> Optional[Tuple[float, float]]:
            model.set_weights(weights)  # Update model with the latest parameters
            loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(x_val, y_val)
            return loss, accuracy

        return evaluate

    # Load and compile model for server-side parameter evaluation
    model = tf.keras.applications.EfficientNetB0(
        input_shape=(32, 32, 3), weights=None, classes=10
    )
    model.compile("adam", "sparse_categorical_crossentropy", metrics=["accuracy"])


    # Create strategy
    strategy = fl.server.strategy.FedAvg(
        # ... other FedAvg agruments 
        eval_fn=get_eval_fn(model),
    )

    # Start Flower server for four rounds of federated learning
    fl.server.start_server("[::]:8080", strategy=strategy)

Custom Strategies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :code:`Strategy` abstraction provides a method called :code:`evaluate` that can direcly be used to evaluate the current global model parameters.
The current server implementation calls :code:`evaluate` after parameter aggregation and before federated evaluation (see next paragraph).


Federated Evaluation
--------------------

Implementing Federated Evaluation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Client-side evaluation happens in the :code:`Client.evaluate` method and can be configured from the server side.

.. code-block:: python

    class CifarClient(fl.client.NumPyClient):
        def __init__(self, model, x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test):
            self.model = model
            self.x_train, self.y_train = x_train, y_train
            self.x_test, self.y_test = x_test, y_test

        def get_parameters(self):
            # ...

        def fit(self, parameters, config):
            # ...

        def evaluate(self, parameters, config):
            """Evaluate parameters on the locally held test set."""

            # Update local model with global parameters
            self.model.set_weights(parameters)

            # Get config values
            steps: int = config["val_steps"]

            # Evaluate global model parameters on the local test data and return results
            loss, accuracy = self.model.evaluate(self.x_test, self.y_test, 32, steps=steps)
            num_examples_test = len(self.x_test)
            return loss, num_examples_test, {"accuracy": accuracy}

Configuring Federated Evaluation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Federated evaluation can be configured from the server side. Built-in strategies support the following arguments:

- :code:`fraction_eval`: a :code:`float` defining the fraction of clients that will be selected for evaluation. If :code:`fraction_eval` is set to :code:`0.1` and :code:`100` clients are connected to the server, then :code:`10` will be randomly selected for evaluation.
- :code:`min_eval_clients`: an :code:`int`: the minimum number of clients to be selected for evaluation. If :code:`fraction_eval` is set to :code:`0.1`, :code:`min_eval_clients` is set to 20, and :code:`100` clients are connected to the server, then :code:`20` clients will be selected for evaluation.
- :code:`min_available_clients`: an :code:`int` that defines the minimum number of clients which need to be connected to the server before a round of federated evaluation can start. If fewer than :code:`min_available_clients` are connected to the server, the server will wait until more clients are connected before it continues to sample clients for evaluation.
- :code:`on_evaluate_config_fn`: a function that returns a configuration dictionary which will be sent to the selected clients. The function will be called during each round and provides a convenient way to customize client-side evaluation from the server side, for example, to configure the number of validation steps performed. 

.. code-block:: python

    def evaluate_config(rnd: int):
        """Return evaluation configuration dict for each round.
        Perform five local evaluation steps on each client (i.e., use five
        batches) during rounds one to three, then increase to ten local
        evaluation steps.
        """
        val_steps = 5 if rnd < 4 else 10
        return {"val_steps": val_steps}

    # Create strategy
    strategy = fl.server.strategy.FedAvg(
        # ... other FedAvg agruments
        fraction_eval=0.2,
        min_eval_clients=2,
        min_available_clients=10,
        on_evaluate_config_fn=evaluate_config,
    )

    # Start Flower server for four rounds of federated learning
    fl.server.start_server("[::]:8080", strategy=strategy)


Evaluating Local Model Updates During Training
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Model parameters can also be evaluated during training. :code:`Client.fit` can return arbitrary evaluation results as a dictionary:

.. code-block:: python

    class CifarClient(fl.client.NumPyClient):
        def __init__(self, model, x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test):
            self.model = model
            self.x_train, self.y_train = x_train, y_train
            self.x_test, self.y_test = x_test, y_test

        def get_parameters(self):
            # ...

        def fit(self, parameters, config):
            """Train parameters on the locally held training set."""

            # Update local model parameters
            self.model.set_weights(parameters)

            # Train the model using hyperparameters from config
            history = self.model.fit(
                self.x_train, self.y_train, batch_size=32, epochs=2, validation_split=0.1
            )

            # Return updated model parameters and validation results
            parameters_prime = self.model.get_weights()
            num_examples_train = len(self.x_train)
            results = {
                "loss": history.history["loss"][0],
                "accuracy": history.history["accuracy"][0],
                "val_loss": history.history["val_loss"][0],
                "val_accuracy": history.history["val_accuracy"][0],
            }
            return parameters_prime, num_examples_train, results

        def evaluate(self, parameters, config):
            # ...
